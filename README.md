# Digital-Watch-
This program displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The time is updated every second.

Please note that:

- The `for` loop is used to create a delay of approximately 1 second. This is not the most accurate method, but it's sufficient for a simple digital watch.
- The `cout` statement with the escape sequence `\033[2J\033[1;1H` is used to clear the screen. This might not work on all platforms.

To exit the program, you can use `Ctrl+C` or your platform's equivalent.
